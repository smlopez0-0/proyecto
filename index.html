                    <h3>What is Pop-Rock?</h3>
                    Pop rock is a genre of music that combines elements of pop music with rock music. It typically
                    features catchy melodies, upbeat rhythms, and accessible lyrics, making it appealing to a wide
                    audience. Pop rock emerged in the late 1960s as a fusion of the melodic sensibilities of pop music
                    with the instrumentation and attitude of rock.

                    <h3>Origin</h3>
                    The origin of pop rock can be traced back to the mid-20th century when rock and roll was evolving
                    into different subgenres. As rock music became more diverse, some artists began to incorporate
                    elements of pop music into their sound, creating a more melodic and commercially appealing style.
                    The Beatles are often credited with popularizing pop rock with their catchy melodies, harmonies, and
                    experimentation with studio techniques in albums like "Rubber Soul" and "Revolver."
